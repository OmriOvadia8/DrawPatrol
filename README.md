## Brief
DrawPatrol is a heartwarming drawing game primarily for kids, aimed at supporting IDF soldiers through art.
Players can express their creativity by either starting from a blank canvas or coloring over pre-made black and white Israel-themed templates.
These artistic creations are periodically sent to IDF soldiers to cheer them up and show solidarity.
DrawPatrol not only encourages children's creativity but also fosters empathy, making each drawing a meaningful gesture of support and care.

## Firebase
In DrawPatrol, we have integrated Firebase to enhance the game's functionality and user experience.
Firebase plays a crucial role in our project in the following ways:

### Storage
We use Firebase Storage to securely store all the drawings created by players.
This feature ensures that every piece of art made in the game is safely uploaded and stored, ready to be shared with IDF soldiers.

### Analytics
Firebase Analytics helps us gain valuable insights into player activity.
By analyzing how players interact with DrawPatrol, we can continually improve the game experience, making it more engaging and user-friendly.

### Crashlytics
To ensure a smooth and error-free gaming experience, we've implemented Firebase Crashlytics.
This tool helps us in promptly identifying and resolving any issues that might arise, maintaining the game's stability and reliability.
